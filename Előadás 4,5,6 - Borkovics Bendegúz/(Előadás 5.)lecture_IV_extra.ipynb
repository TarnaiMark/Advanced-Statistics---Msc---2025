    "## Some homework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A factory claims that its light bulbs last on average 800 hours. A sample of $n=25$ bulbs has a sample mean lifetime of 780 hours, with a known population standard deviation of 50 hours.\\\n",
    "    Test the hypothesis $H_0:\\mu=800$ vs. $H_1:\\mu<800$ at 5% significance. Compute the power function for $\\mu=770$.\\\n",
    "    Hint: Firstly, compute the critical value $c$ using the $Z$-score at $\\alpha$ with $\\mu=800$. Secondly, compute the power function\n",
    "     $P\\left(\\overline{X}\\leq c|\\mu=770\\right)$.\n",
    "2. A researcher tests whether a new fertilizer increases plant growth. The null hypothesis is that the mean plant height is 50 cm.\\\n",
    "    If the sample mean is 52 cm, standard deviation is 5 cm, and $n=36$, compute the power of the test at $\\mu=53$, given a 5% significance level.\n",
    "3. A drug manufacturer claims that its painkiller provides relief in 30 minutes. A test is conducted where $n=20$ patients take the drug, and the sample mean relief time is 28 minutes with a sample standard deviation of 4 minutes.\\\n",
    "    Compute the level of the test if the rejection region is set at $\\overline{X}\\leq27$.\\\n",
    "    Hint: Firstly, compute the test statistic ($t$-test). Secondly, compute the level $P\\left(\\overline{X}\\leq 27|\\mu=30\\right)$.\n",
    "4. A company tests a new battery and wants to control the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0:\\mu=500$ hours.\\\n",
    "    If they set a critical value of 490 hours based on a sample of $n=40$ and a standard deviation of 20 hours, find the level of the test.\n",
    "5. A researcher conducts a two-tailed test for the mean cholesterol level of a population with $H_0:\\mu=200$. The sample size is $n=36$, and the population standard deviation is 15.\\\n",
    "    Find the critical values for a 1% significance level.\\\n",
    "    Hint: First, compute the critical $Z$-values. (2-sided test: 2 critical $Z$s at $\\alpha/2$ and $(1-\\alpha/2)$) Then, compute the lower and upper critical values.\n",
    "6. In a quality control test, the weight of a product is tested using a one-tailed test at a 5% significance level. If the sample size is 25, and the population standard deviation is 3, determine the critical value for rejecting $H_0:\\mu\\geq10$.\n",
    "7. A survey shows that the average time students spend studying is 4.5 hours per day. A test is conducted with a sample of $n=49$, finding a sample mean of 4.2 hours and a population standard deviation of 1.4 hours.\\\n",
    "    Compute the $p$-value for testing $H_0:\\mu=4.5$ vs. $H_1:\\mu\\neq4.5$.\\\n",
    "    Hint: First, compute the $Z$-test statistic. Then, compute the $p$-value. This is a 2-sided test: $p\\text{-value}=2\\cdot P(Z<z)$.\n",
    "8. A researcher tests whether a new diet plan reduces average body weight. The null hypothesis states that the average weight before the diet is 75 kg. After a month, a sample of $n=16$ people has an average weight of 72 kg with a sample standard deviation of 6 kg.\\\n",
    "    Compute the $p$-value for testing $H_0:\\mu=75$ vs. $H_1:\\mu<75$."
